						The best part about a mobile office is that it is, well, mobile. To be mobile you need to have a setup where each  piece of gear serves multiple purposes, is light and compact, and is easy to carry without having to worry about something getting messed up. So, what happens when you or a client need to sign a document or form?	
						<br /><br />
						Well, normally, you would have to print out the document, put it in a folder (hopefully one that looks halfway presentable), put it in your bag, and pray that it isn’t a rumpled mess when you show up. Luckily for you mobile officer warriors there is another option to those paper and pen lottery and it is the digital signature. 
						<br /><br />
						The debate over the “digital” signature has actually been going on since the first ever telegraph where people, for the first time, we are able to make agreements over long distances and not actually be in the presence of one another or it not be “in writing.” However, not until 1999 and 2000, did digital signatures become “official” in the United States. Two laws were passed which caused the government to have to accept digital signatures as official. This opened the door for digital signatures to grow, but, unfortunately, just because the government had to accept digital signatures didn’t mean businesses had to accept them. So, for years, though the groundwork had been laid for digital signatures to be used, they were ignored. But now, they are set to explode as more and more businesses are trying to reduce overhead, be more mobile, and decrease their impact on the environment. 
						<br /><br />
						But why should you use digital signatures for your mobile office? As always, I love it when you ask questions. Here are some reasons why I think that you should be utilizing digital signatures in your mobile office and/or business:
						<br /><br />
						<strong>1. Allows you to be mobile -</strong> No more having to carry extra paper or folders (or heaven forbid an actual printer) around or fumbling for a pen. If you have a smartphone or tablet, you are good to go. Some services even allow you to store your signature online or in a program and you can sign directly from your computer or web browser. 
						<br /><br />
						<strong>2. Helps you to be more efficient -</strong> You don’t have to reprint pages if something gets spilled, you don’t have to travel for a meeting, and you can simply email the signed document to its recipient once it is signed. No more hassle with trying to mesh agendas or fight traffic. You or your customer/client can digitally sign that document from the comfort of your home and you can have it back that same day. 
						<br /><br />
						<strong>3. Saves trees -</strong> Personally, I love trees and the more we have the happier I am so I think this is a great reason to use digital signatures. You have no idea how many signature pages I have had to throw away or reprint due to someone signing or initialing incorrectly. I am kind of ashamed actually. Being serious though, in what seems to be the impossible task of moving towards a completely paperless businesses, using digital signatures will help reduce your carbon footprint.
						<br /><br />
						You have the reasons to utilize digital signatures, but what about the tools needed? Well, like I mentioned all you really need is a smartphone or tablet (or even a browser) and one of several apps which are specifically designed for digital signatures. From my research, it appears that the two most popular apps currently are SignNow and DocuSign. Both of these apps offer different features but are essentially the same when it comes to the main purpose of the app: digitally signing documents. Which one you choose is really up to your preferences and the features you would prefer to have. However, if you know any apps that are better or have more features, I would love to hear about them. 
						<br /><br />
						To digitally sign a document, you simply import it from a Cloud service like Dropbox or from your device’s local storage, review the document, and place your signature and/or initials where you need to. With DocuSign you can place specific boxes where things need to be signed or initialled. It really is quite a handy tool. Once you have signed the document, you then send it on to where it needs to go, and you are done. And in case you are worried about record keeping, these apps track what documents you sign so that you can refer to them in the future. 
						<br /><br />
						There you have it. A (semi-)paperless, mobile office with the help of using digital signatures. What do you think though? Do you think digital signatures are the way to go or should we stick with physical signatures?
